Yes, that makes perfect sense! You want a comprehensive product specification for the **BookGPT** project, but instead of being a standalone app (e.g., launched on Vercel), it should be architected and delivered as a **WordPress plugin** (or script for a WordPress site). The chatbot interface should appear as a floating chat box at the bottom right of the page, like typical support chat widgets. All other core functionality should remain the same.

Below is an ultra comprehensive product specification tailored for this scenario:
